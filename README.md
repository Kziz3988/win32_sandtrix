# About the Project

The codes are in 'main.asm'. You can compile it with masm32, or open the whole project with Visual Studio 2017.

The compiled executable file is 'sandtrix.exe'. You can run it directly.

Since I have just started learning assembly, the code quality is poor. Please feel free to give a improvement.

# How to Play

Use the left and right arrow to shift a brick (or a tetromino), A and D to rotate it, and Space to place it (Turning it into sand). You can get some points after a successful placement.

To clear sand and get more points, you need to link a single color from the left to the right of the playfield, just like the original Sandtrix.

The game ends when sand piles up to the top line. You can start a new game by clicking the RESTART button.
